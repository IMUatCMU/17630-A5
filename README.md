# A5 - Six Degrees

To run, ensure you have Java 1.8 installed and `$JAVA_HOME` environment variable set.

```
./gradlew build
java -jar build/libs/a5-1.0.jar
```
Checkout the test cases in `src/main/test/java/edu/cmu/cs4pe/a5` for API usage examples.

In case we cannot assume Java 1.8 environment, we can always ship with Java 1.8 runtime with submission and update the script.
